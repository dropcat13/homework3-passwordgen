# homework3-passwordgen

### User Story
The user wants to generate a password, specifying its length and the type of characters. They are prompted to pick a number between 8 and 128 for the number of characters in the password, then are asked if they want lowercase, uppercase, numbers or special characters. If they pick a too short or too long password they are prompted to try again. similarly if they don't choose any character options they are also asked to pick again. 
Once they user has chosen their requirements the password is generated and displayed on the screen. 
When the user clicks on the copy to clipboard option the file is copied to their computer or phone clipboard with an alert to let the user know what is happening. The password generator box is reset at this time, so a user could generate a new password and so their old password isn't left sitting around in full view.
